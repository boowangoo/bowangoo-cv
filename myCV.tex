\mysection{Experience}
\subsection{UW's Solar Racing Team (Midnight Sun)}
\begin{desc}
    \item Wrote software for MSP430 and STM32 microcontrollers in C within a Linux environment
    \item Implemented an UART Hardware Abstraction Layer to facillitate device communications
    \item Developed a deep understanding in embedded systems concepts and lower-level programming concepts
\end{desc}
\subsection{IEEE Ottawa Robotics Competition}
\begin{desc}
    \item Used C++ to program a motor-controlled Arduino robot equiped with Ultrasound and Infared sensors
    \item Integrated the sensor inputs so that the robot can autonomously run through a maze with obstacles
    \item Used a state-based approach to complete the mazes in the fewest amount of turns possible
\end{desc}

\mysection{Projects}
\subsection{MrSudokuBot (Reddit, Python)}
\begin{desc}
    \item Utilized the PRAW API with Python to create an automated program that scanned user comments on Reddit
    \item The bot takes Sudoku puzzles extracted from the comments, and returns its solutions as a comment reply
    \item Solved the puzzle recursively and took advantage of Python's powerful object-oriented capabilities
\end{desc}\subsection{Personal Website (ReactJS)}
\begin{desc}
    \item Deployed a static website that can be used as a personal portfolio and blog
    \item Used ReactJS as the front-end, so that the site's components can be developed and implemented modularly
    \item Took advantage of ReactJS' VirtualDOM, leading to efficient rendering of the website
\end{desc}
\subsection{Hexxer (C++)}
\begin{desc}
    \item Developed a virtual boardgame in C++, using an object oriented approach
    \item Rendered the display and 2D graphical components using the SDL2 helper library
\end{desc}
\subsection{TwentyFortyShake (Android, Java)}
\begin{desc}
    \item Created a variation of the popular 2048 game, taking in the phone's motion gestures as user input
    \item Developed a finite state machine, which processes the raw sensor inputs as directional outputs
\end{desc}
\subsection{Peter's Lost World (Java)}
\begin{desc}
    \item Developed a multi-level, top-down, maze game at the request of elementary school students
\end{desc}
